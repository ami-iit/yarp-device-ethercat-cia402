# Store Home Position üß≠

## Overview üåü
Utility to set and persist the home position on EtherCAT CiA402 drives. It:
- Switches drives to Homing mode (CiA-402) and performs homing using method 37 (set current position as home) or 35.
- Optionally applies a home offset before persisting.
- Sets the vendor flag to restore the home at boot (if requested).
- Stores the new configuration to non-volatile memory.

The app talks via SDOs only; it does not drive motion trajectories. It operates on all slaves detected on the specified network interface.

> Note: Tested on Linux. Requires raw-socket/network admin capabilities to access EtherCAT via SOEM.

## Post-Install Setup üîß
After installing the project, make sure the binary can find its libraries and has the required capabilities:

```console
patchelf --add-rpath $(dirname $(dirname $(which yarp-cia402-store-home-position)))/lib $(which yarp-cia402-store-home-position)
sudo setcap 'cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin+ep' "$(readlink -f $(which yarp-cia402-store-home-position))"
```

## Usage üöÄ

Run the tool with your network interface and desired options:

```bash
yarp-cia402-store-home-position \
	--ifname eth0 \
	--method 37 \
	--home-offset 0 \
	--timeout-ms 2000 \
	--restore-on-boot 1
```

You will be asked for an interactive confirmation (press ENTER) before proceeding.

### Options ‚öôÔ∏è
- `--ifname`: Network interface used by SOEM (default: `eth0`).
- `--method`: Homing method `37` (current position as home) or `35` (default: `37`).
- `--home-offset`: Additional home offset in encoder ticks (default: `0`).
- `--timeout-ms`: Homing attained wait timeout in milliseconds (default: `2000`).
- `--restore-on-boot`: `1/true` to mark the drive as referenced at boot, `0/false` otherwise (default: `1`).

### Configuration file (optional) üìù
You can also provide options through a YARP `.ini` file and pass it with `--from`:

```ini
# store_home.ini
ifname eth0
method 37
home-offset 0
timeout-ms 2000
restore-on-boot true
```

Run with:

```bash
yarp-cia402-store-home-position --from store_home.ini
```

## What It Does üß†
For each discovered slave on `--ifname`:
- Sets `0x6060 = 6` (Homing mode), writes `0x6098 = method` and optional `0x607C = home-offset`.
- Triggers homing by toggling Controlword bit 4 and polls Statusword until homing attained.
- Sets vendor flag `0x2005:02` according to `--restore-on-boot`.
- Saves parameters with `0x1010:01 = 'evas'`.

## Safety Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Ensure the current mechanical position is the desired reference when using method 37.
- Verify axis is in a safe state; method 35 may involve motion as per drive firmware.
- Using `--restore-on-boot 1` makes the drive boot already referenced; validate alignment and encoder polarity beforehand.
